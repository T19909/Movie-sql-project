# Using SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals

# Description

In this project, i used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. The Questions of interest investigated are stated below. As for the project I ran SQL queries and built visualizations to showcase the output of my queries which is shown by the short PDF deck.

Question 1: We wanted to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music. Which Family Category had the highest rentals?

Question 2: Wanted to find out the total number family-Movies (Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music) within each Standard Quartile compared to there duration. We can see that most family movies fall into quartile 1

 Question 3: Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category.

 Question 4: I wanted to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Wrote a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.
